Problem 1
=========

``` r
## Import and clean data by creating binary variables for unsolved dispositions and race, filter out irrelevant cities
homicide = read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv")) 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

``` r
homicide = homicide %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
         resolved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest"),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
         victim_race = ifelse(victim_race == "White", c("White"), c("Non-white")),
         victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White")) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Dallas, TX" & 
         city_state != "Phoenix, AZ" & 
         city_state != "Kansas City, MO" & 
         city_state != "Tulsa, AL")
```

    ## Warning in evalq(as.numeric(victim_age), <environment>): NAs introduced by
    ## coercion

In the code chunk above, I imported and cleaned the data. At first I was worried about the warning message when I recoded `victim_age` as a factor variable, but upon looking at the original data set there were instances in which the victim's age was unknown. These were changed to NAs when recoded to numeric, so I didn't see this as a problem.

``` r
## Fit logistic regression using age, race, and sex as predictors for resolved
baltimore_logistic = 
  homicide %>% 
  filter(city_state== "Baltimore, MD") %>%
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial()) 

## Make a table showing the odds ratio and 95% CI 
baltimore_logistic %>%  
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
         OR_upper_bound = exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error),
         OR_lower_bound = exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error)) %>%
  select(term, starts_with("OR")) %>%
  filter(term == "victim_raceNon-white") %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term                  |     OR|  OR\_upper\_bound|  OR\_lower\_bound|
|:----------------------|------:|-----------------:|-----------------:|
| victim\_raceNon-white |  0.441|              0.62|             0.313|

From this regression model, the odds of a homicide of a non-white victim being resolved in Baltimore is 0.44 times the odds of a homicide of a white victim being resolved, holding all other variables constant. We are 95% confident that the true odds ratio is between 0.31 and 0.62.

``` r
## Apply logistic regression function to each city, save results as a dataframe showing ORs and 95% CIs
homicide_logistic = homicide %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  nest() %>%  
  mutate(regression = map(data, ~glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial())),
         regression = map(regression, broom::tidy)) %>% 
  select(-data) %>%
  unnest()%>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
         OR_upper_bound = exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error),
         OR_lower_bound = exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error)) %>%
  select(city_state, term, starts_with("OR")) %>%
  filter(term == "victim_raceNon-white") 
```

``` r
## Make a plot show ORs and CIs from each city
homicide_logistic %>%
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = OR)) +
    geom_point() +
    coord_flip() +
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = OR_lower_bound, ymax = OR_upper_bound)) +
    labs(x = "Location", y = "Odds Ratio", title = "Odds Ratios of Non-white Homicides being Resolved Compared to White Homicides") +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 1, color = "red") +
    theme_bw() 
```

From this plot, we can see that in most large US cities, the odds ratio of a non-white homicide being resolved compared to a white homicide being resolved is less than 1.0, indicating that less non-white homicides are solved (holding all other variables constant). However, there are several cities where the 95% CI includes 1.0, so further investigation into these cities is required in order to determine if the true OR is less than 1.0.

Problem 2
---------

``` r
birthweight = read_csv("./birthweight.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_integer(),
    ##   gaweeks = col_double(),
    ##   ppbmi = col_double(),
    ##   smoken = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.
