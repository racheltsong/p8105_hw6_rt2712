Problem 1
=========

``` r
## Import and clean data by creating binary variables for unsolved dispositions and race, filter out irrelevant cities
homicide = read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv")) 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

``` r
homicide = homicide %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
         unsolved = ifelse(disposition != "Closed by arrest", TRUE, FALSE),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
         victim_race = ifelse(victim_race == "White", c("white"), c("non-white")),
         victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "white")) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Dallas, TX" & 
         city_state != "Phoenix, AZ" & 
         city_state != "Kansas City, MO" & 
         city_state != "Tulsa, AL")
```

    ## Warning in evalq(as.numeric(victim_age), <environment>): NAs introduced by
    ## coercion

In the code chunk above, I imported and cleaned the data. At first I was worried about the warning message when I recoded `victim_age` as a factor variable, but upon looking at the original data set there were instances in which the victim's age was unknown. These were changed to NAs when recoded to numeric, so I didn't see this as a problem.
